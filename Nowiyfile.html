            <p class="c1">Thanos eventually found the Soul Stone on the planet Vormir, and made the decision to murder his adopted daughter Gamora in order to receive it. On Vormir, we were also reunited with Captain America: The First Avenger villain Red Skull, who was a shadow of his former self, and had been charged with with watching over the Soul Stone. The Time Stone can be used to turn back time, and the Reality Stone can be used to alter reality, so it's easy to see how those artifacts could be devastating in battle, but what exactly is the Soul Stone's power? The Soul Stone has the ability to manipulate your soul, the essence of who you are. One key moment where itâ€™s used is where Doctor Strange turns into multiple Stranges and then Thanos uses the Soul Stone to eradicate all the fake Stranges and momentarily shoves Strange out of his own body, and Strange has to pull himself back inâ€¦ Of course when Thanos goes to the Soul Stone itself, to speak to his dead daughter, he obviously has an ability to resurrect, conjure the spiritual representation of the people who are dead."Gamora's spirit is actually trapped in a place called Soul World, a pocket dimension held within the Soul Stone. After successfully wiping out half of all life in the universe, Thanos visits Soul World and finds young Gamora there waiting for him. She asks him if he accomplished his goal, and he says that he did. She then asks, "What did it cost?" - to which a heartbroken Thanos replies, "Everything." </p>

            <p>The Time Stone grants its owner the power to re-wind or fast-forward time. It also allows the user total control over the past, present and future. Its most basic ability grants its user visions of possible futures. It allows time travel, control over the age of beings and also be used as a weapon by trapping enemies or entire worlds in unending loops of time. At its peak, when used with the other gems, it allows its user to exist at all points in time simultaneously. Stephen Strange discovers it in the Eye of Agomoto pendant in the library of Kamar-Taj, where he trains in the mystic arts in Doctor Strange. He uses the stone at the end of the film to trap the villain Dormammu in a time loop so that Dormammu canâ€™t destroy the Earth. Wisely, Doctor Strange doesnâ€™t hand over the stone to a sketchy junk collector or a hapless policeman and decides to watch over it himself. He returns the Stone to Kamar-Taj, where he currently resides, at the end of the movie.</p>

            <p>The Space Stone or the Tesseract was first seen in Captan America The First Avenger. Where a evil organization HYDRA used the Tesseract to power their weapons in, but Captain America crashed a plane containing the Tesseract at the end of that movie. The stone made reapperents when loki comes down to earth amd steals it to make a portal. When the Red Skull holds it in his bare hand, he describes the Stone â€œcasting him outâ€, as it creates a wromhole dragging him to a black hole, this also implies it has other powers. Erik Selvig is able to manipulate it to form a worm hole allowing the Chitauri to invade. Thor then uses it to teleport him and Loki back to Asgard. In Infinity War, Thanos smashes its cubic container and uses it primarily for teleporting vast distances. However he also uses it for creating gravitational fields to stop Lokiâ€™ assassination attempt. On Titan he uses it to grab chunks of Titanâ€™s moon and hurl them as meteorites (along with usage of other stones). In The Snap, itâ€™s used to affect beings all across Space.</p>

             <p>The Mind Stone allows the user to control the minds of others. We first see it as a blue orb in Lokiâ€™s scepter in The Avengers. Whenever Loki touches someone with the scepter, he can control what they do. Thanos gives the Mind Stone to Loki, which places a lot of faith in Loki, a hilarious but not particularly accomplished villain. Weird decision, Thanos.The Avengers recover Lokiâ€™s scepter at the beginning of Avengers: Age of Ultron. Tony Stark and Bruce Banner use the Mind Stone to create Ultron , an artificially intelligent peace-keeping program. Apparently, those two have not read Frankenstein because theyâ€™re super surprised when Ultron turns on them.After some bickering, the Avengers eventually use the Mind Stone to create another android, Vision. The stone gives Vision a lot of powers, including super-strength, the ability to fly and the power to phase through walls and people like a ghost. Curiously, it does not give him the ability to control minds. </p>

             <p>The Reality Stone the 2nd stone of the six Infinity Stones. We first see this stone in Thor The Dark World were Malekith, the leader of the Dark Elves, created a weapon out of the Reality Stone called the Aether. It is known to be able to convert matter into dark matter, and otherwise maintains an almost lifelike existence that causes it to bond in a parasitic fashion to a living host. Once bonded, the energies of the Aether slowly consume any mortal host, and also have a volatile and deadly effect on any who come into contact with the host in a manner that the Aether perceives as threatening. Bonded with a stronger host that understands its power, the Aether can be employed as a weapon where it lashes out with a concussive force, or reaches out to convert matter. During its brief time bonded to Malekith, the Aether also enhanced his physical form, causing him to grow threefold in height.The Reality Stone gives the user the ability to control dark-forces and at full power, manipulate reality. It can also revive the dead. It can even restore lost body parts of it's hosts. </p>

             <p>Although the Stone has much broader powers in the comics - ones which likely come from the Stonesâ€™ longer existence in that universe - in the movies, the stoneâ€™s powers are somewhat more narrowly defined. Based on the ways it is used in Guardians of the Galaxy, the Stoneâ€™s main powers are enhanced durability and strength, and energy projection. The Power Stone bestows upon its holder a lot of energyâ€”the sort of energy that you could use to destroy an entire planet. Star Lord accidentally discovers the stone in Guardians of the Galaxy. Ronan the Accuser steals it from him and threatens to wipe out an entire race.But hereâ€™s the tricky thing about Infinity Stones: You canâ€™t hold them in your hand for long without dying. (More on that later.) Peter steals the stone back from Ronan and almost dies when holding it. (All the Guardians join hands, and together they can manage its power. Hooray for teamwork!)The Guardiansâ€”you may start to notice a theme hereâ€”give it to Nova Corps, the space police, for safekeeping.But the officers in Nova Corps are pretty bad at their jobs. So it was probaly super easy for Thanos to take it.</p>
